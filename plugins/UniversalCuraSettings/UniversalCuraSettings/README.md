## Why is it called Universal Cura Settings

Initial settings come from some profiles released by **Jonas Idebrant** aka [printingotb](https://github.com/printingotb) on the Cura Facebook Group. The main idea was to publish a Universal Cura Settings profile based on his own printing experience. I had for a long time the idea to create a plugin that could set some standard parameters instead of always using profiles. When we merge the two ideas you get this UniversalCuraSettings plugin. 

**Note: It's still a "Concept" use it carefully.**
